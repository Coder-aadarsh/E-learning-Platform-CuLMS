The proposed project aims to develop an E-Learning Website 
using cloud computing technology. The platform will offer a 
peer-to-peer learning management system (P2P LMS) for 
users to access the platform securely. The website will have a 
clean interface and offer features such as Admin and user 
dashboards, Reviews, Course Manager, Prerequisites, 
Payment, and a Control Panel for managing courses and user 
data. The project will be divided into multiple stages, including 
problem formulation, research objectives, literature review, 
methodologies, experimental setup, and conclusion.

he P2P Learning Platform project aims to develop a cloud - based E-Learning website that utilizes a peer-to-peer learning 
management system (P2P LMS) for secure access to the 
platform. The platform successfully accomplishes the desired 
objectives.
As a result, we get a P2P community-focused e-learning 
application that is designed to facilitate online education. Many 
general objectives were set for the project, which were achieved 
properly. As of now application offer – an admin panel which 
is used to control the application and can only be accessed by 
administrators, and a User panel which is where users log in 
and are able to create their own courses for the public or can 
consume content and courses provided by other instructors on 
the platform.
